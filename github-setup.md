# Pushing to GitHub

After creating your repository on GitHub, follow these steps to push your code:

## Connect your local repository to GitHub

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username and REPO_NAME with your repository name
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## If you're using SSH authentication instead of HTTPS

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username and REPO_NAME with your repository name
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```
